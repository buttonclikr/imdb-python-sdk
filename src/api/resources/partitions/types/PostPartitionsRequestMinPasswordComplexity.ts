 * The minimum level of complexity that all passwords used in this Partition must have.
 * There are four complexity 'factors' that can be evaluated. These are the presence of the following character types in the password: lowercase characters, uppercase characters, integers and special characters. For instance, the password '123a' would get a complexity rating of '2', since it contains integers and lowercase characters.
